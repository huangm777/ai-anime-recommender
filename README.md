# Ai (愛), the AI Anime Recommender
## Introduction
This is Ai, an under development AI driven (Google Gemini or MyAnimeList) anime recommender that picks anime you'd likely enjoy if you already like one title. The user can choose whether to use an LLM (Google Gemini first, GPT 4.0 forthcoming) or MyAnimeList's built in recommender. Users will also be able to mark favorite titles and queries and save them to their accounts. There's even an "omakase!" (お任せ) option that picks random titles, kind of like the "I'm feeling lucky" button on Google.

### Platforms and frameworks used
The front end is written in Next.js with Tailwind CSS. Anime thumbnails and title information are drawn from the [Anilist GraphQL public API](https://docs.anilist.co/). 

### Proposed UI
